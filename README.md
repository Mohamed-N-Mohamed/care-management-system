# care-management-system
CRUD Application with node js, express and mongodb. I created this app to create a soloution in the place I was volunteering. Everytime a carer goes to a client, the carer has to fill the infomarion such as name, age, address and medications that the client requires. The probelm was we had to print papers and store them in boxes. Sometimes it gets messy and no one can sort all of these infomarion. So I suggest to create an app which stores information into a database and access them online. It's CRUD which means create, read update, and delete. So now we have a way to view the information and either update, or delete them
